# Solar-Energy-Modeling-for-Floating-Photovoltaic-Systems-on-Inland-Reservoirs
As part of a research project on floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems, I developed a custom Python implementation of the Sukhatme-Nayak tilted irradiance model to convert NASA POWER GHI data into Tilted Global Irradiance (TGI) for several Romanian reservoirs. The algorithm, inspired by a Perl script from a peer-reviewed study on Sicilian lakes ([Springer, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12517-021-06674-7)), was enhanced to calculate beam, diffuse, and reflected components using solar geometry equations (declination, sunset hour angle, clearness index, etc.). GIS data extracted from QGIS CSV files allowed geospatial analysis to identify high-potential FPV locations by integrating environmental and technical criteria. The code provides irradiance simulations across various tilt angles and locations, supporting optimal site selection for solar deployment.
