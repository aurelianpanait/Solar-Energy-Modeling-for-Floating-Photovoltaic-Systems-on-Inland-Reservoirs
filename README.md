# Solar-Energy-Modeling-for-Floating-Photovoltaic-Systems-on-Inland-Reservoirs
Developed a Python algorithm based on the Sukhatme-Nayak model to convert NASA POWER GHI data into TGI for Romanian reservoirs. Calculated beam, diffuse, and reflected components using solar geometry. Identified optimal floating PV sites through spatial and statistical analysis.
